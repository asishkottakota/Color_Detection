# Color Detection

The color detection project is a simple yet effective program that detects the dominant color from an image and displays it along with the color name. The project is implemented using Python programming language and two popular libraries - OpenCV and Pandas.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this color detection project are as follows:

*   To read an image in RGB format and convert it into a pandas dataframe for manipulation
*   To apply processing techniques using OpenCV to identify the most common color present in the image and its corresponding color name
*   To display the image along with the identified color and its name

## Methodology

The following is a brief overview of the methodology used in this project:

1.  Import the necessary libraries - OpenCV, Numpy, and Pandas
2.  Load the input image in RGB format and convert it into a pandas dataframe
3.  Determine the color present in the image using dataset provided in the csv file
4.  Map the RGB color value to its corresponding name using a dataframe of color names
5.  Display the input image along with the identified color and its name

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this color detection project using OpenCV and Pandas libraries is a simple yet powerful program that can detect the dominant colors from an image and display them along with their corresponding names. This project has immense practical applications in a variety of fields such as image processing, computer vision, and data analysis. By utilizing the advanced features of OpenCV and Pandas libraries, this project showcases the power of Python programming language in solving real-world problems with ease and efficiency.
